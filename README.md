#WebStarterKit
The repository contains a small web starter project with responsive layout based on flex box.
The project is configured to utilize AMD pattern.
The project has configured Gulp tasks for JavaScript minification, add prefixes and minifuing css files (all in watch mode), running default system browser (with synch).
Development directories are under app folder - styles for css and js for JavaScript.
Being processed from Gulp the css and JavaScript files are being placed in build folder - /js/some.js and ./css/some.css
Please note that this is project on go and it does not contain many pages as templates (now it has two pages - Home and Login pages).
I am intended to enlarge the project (add a few additional pages).
To use it just copy/clone the repo and open it with VisualStudio Code.
You need to have Node and Gulp installed on your machine.
